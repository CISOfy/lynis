    shortDescription: Security auditing tool for Linux, macOS, and UNIX-based systems
    longDescription: Lynis is a security auditing tool for systems based on UNIX
      like Linux, macOS, BSD, and others. It performs an in-depth security scan
      and runs on the system itself. The primary goal is to test security
      defenses and provide tips for further system hardening. It will also scan
      for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and possible
      configuration issues. Lynis was commonly used by system administrators and
      auditors to assess the security defenses of their systems. Besides the
      "blue team," nowadays penetration testers also have Lynis in their
      toolkit.
