.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBLynis\fP is an auditing tool for Unix (specialists). It checks the system
and software configuration and logs all the found information into a log file
for debugging purposes, and in a report file suitable to create fancy looking
auditing reports.
\fBLynis\fP can be run as a cronjob, or from the command line. It needs to have
full access to the system, so running it as root (or with sudo rights) is
required.
