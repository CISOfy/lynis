[+] Introduction

  Lynis is an auditing tool which tests and gathers (security) information from
  Unix based systems. The audience for this tool are security and system
  auditors, network specialists and system maintainers.

  Some of the (future) features and usage options:
  - System and security audit checks
  - File Integrity Assessment
  - System and file forensics
  - Usage of templates/baselines (reporting and monitoring)
  - Extended debugging features

  Everyone is free to use Lynis under the conditions of the GPL v3 license (see

  following methods:

  - Create a custom directory (ie. /usr/local/lynis) and unpack the tarball
    (tar xfvz lynis-version.tar.gz) into this directory.
  - Create a RPM package by using the lynis.spec file (see web site)
    run 'rpmbuild -ta lynis-version.tar.gz' (= build RPM package)
    run 'rpm -ivh <filename>' (= install RPM package)

  See online documentation for detailed instructions.
